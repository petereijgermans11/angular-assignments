Angular services
=====================================================

An Angular Service is added to the providers array of an Angular Module.
> A provider is a resource or JavaScript “thing” that Angular uses to provide (result in, generate) something we want to use:
> - A class provider generates/provides an instance of the class.
> - A factory provider generates/provides whatever returns when you run a specified function.
> - A value provider doesn’t need to take an action to provide the result like the previous two, it just returns its value.
